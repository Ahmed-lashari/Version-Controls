## 📁 What is Version Control?

Version Controls are just like a **time machine for our code base**. It helps us keep track of every change you make in our files.

### 🔧 For Example:
Imagine we are writing an essay. You save a version on Monday, then add more on Tuesday, but on Wednesday you realize Monday’s version was better. Without version control, it's hard to go back. With version control, you can easily **switch between versions**, just like hitting undo.
For Windows: Ctrl + z
for Mac: Command + z

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Git

Git is the most popular version control system. 
***(Git and Github are different thnings with different use cases.)***

Git helps us:

- ✅ **Track Changes**: Know who changed what and when.
- ⏳ **Go Back in Time**: Revert to older versions of your projects.
- 🤝 **Collaborate Easily**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
- 🔒 **Avoid Mistakes**: Fix errors without starting over.
- 🌐 **Work Offline**: Git works on our computer/laptops even without internet.

### 💡 Real-life Example:
You and a friend are building a group project. Git allows both of you to work **on different parts of the code at the same time**, then combine everything smoothly.

## 🥊 Git vs GitHub

| Feature        | Git                                | GitHub                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| What is it?    | A tool to track code changes        | A website to store Git projects online |
| Works Offline? | Yes                                 | No (it's online)                       |
| Use Case       | Local version control               | Sharing, backing up, and collaborating |
| Owner          | Open-source tool                    | Owned by Microsoft                     |

### 🔍 Simple Analogy:
- **Git** is like your **notebook** where you write and edit your code.
- **GitHub** is like **Google Drive** where you upload and share your notebook with your team.
