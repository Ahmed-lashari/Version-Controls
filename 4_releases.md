# 🚀 Releases & Tagging on GitHub

Releases help developers deliver stable versions of their code to users. They are based on **tags** and can include **release notes**, **changelogs**, and **downloadable assets**.

---

## 🏷️ What is a Tag?

A **tag** is a snapshot of your codebase at a specific point in time, often used to mark:
- Releases (v1.0.0, v2.1.4)
- Milestones (beta, stable)
- Deployments

### Creating a Tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
