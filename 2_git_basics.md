# 📦 Setting Up Git & Creating Your First Repository

## 🛠 Step 1: Configure Git on Your Local Machine

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Ahmed Lashari" # you name here

   git config --global user.email "ahmedlashari.official@gmail.com" # your email here.
   ```


This sets your name and email for Git commits.

## 📁 Step 2: Create a New Project

   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-git-project
cd my-first-git-project
```
This creates a new folder for your project and opens it.


## 🚀 Step 3: Initialize Git

   ```bash
   git init
```
This sets up Git in your project folder. It creates a hidden .git folder to track changes.

## ✅ Step 4: Add Your First File

   ```bash
   git add file-name-here # for adding single file
   ```

You can also use:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
This will select and add all the present files from the selected folder.

## Step 5: Commit Changes
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: added xyz file"
   ```


### Now your first file is saved in Git history!
